                    <h2 class="mt-4">Right of Withdrawal for Consumers</h2>
                    <p>You have the right to withdraw from this contract within fourteen days without giving any reason.

                        The withdrawal period is fourteen days from the day the contract is concluded.

                        To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us (CatWebsitesMeow, Bayerwaldstr.21 93059
                        Regensburg or Email catwebsitesmeow@gmail.com) by means of a clear statement (e.g., a letter
                        sent by post or an e-mail) of your decision to withdraw from this contract.

                        To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning
                        your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">Consequences of Withdrawal</h2>
                    <p>If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you,
                        without undue delay and in any event not later than fourteen days from the day on which we are
                        informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. For this repayment, we will use the
                        same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed
                        otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such repayment.

                        If you requested that the services begin during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us an
                        amount which is in proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated us your
                        withdrawal from this contract, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">Note on the Premature Expiry of the Right of Withdrawal</h2>
                    <p>Your right of withdrawal shall expire prematurely in the case of a contract for the provision of
                        services if we have provided the service in full and have only started to perform the service
                        after you have given your express consent thereto and, at the same time, confirmed your
                        knowledge that you will lose your right of withdrawal upon full performance of the contract by
                        us.</p>
